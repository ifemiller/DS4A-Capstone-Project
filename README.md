## Capstone Project: An Exploratory Analysis of the Impact on Nonprofits on the Success of a City

### IRS Nonprofit Filing vs UN 2019 US Cities Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Performance

While it’s generally accepted that nonprofits are crucial public goods, not all cities value them to the same extent. And while many nonprofits rely on funding from all levels of government to sustain annual projects and initiatives, however it can be difficult to secure public funding both initially and year-over-year. By linking a city’s SDG performance to key non-profit metrics, we can demonstrate the value of nonprofits in each metro area. These insights can validate funding for nonprofit initiatives and inform future spending to perpetuate success and development for peer cities.
